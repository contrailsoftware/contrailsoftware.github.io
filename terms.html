      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
      <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

These funds are then distributed to the contest leader or administrator after the buy-in time is over.  The Service is not liable for any loss of funds that may occur after the payout to the administrator occurs. </p>
      <p>The Service reserves the right to add a surcharge to the buy-in amount to cover the cost of the digital transactions and other costs.  The total amount including the buy-in price and fees will be displayed prior to purchasing.  The amount of the surcharge will be a variable amount depending on the amount of the contest buy-in.</p>
      <p>Usage of the Service will be provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.  We will not be responsible for any losses occurring during times where the service is not available.</p>
